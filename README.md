# VIRTUAL 3D CHAT: STREET EXPERIENCE

With our app we want to recreate the daily life of users. The actions they'd usually do when they are out on the street and that they can share with friends or complete strangers. That is why our app is based on a japanese street with several doors. You can go inside a restaurant and play music, you can go to your licing room and watch TV, or you can go to a conference room and connect via webcam to other users.

Feautures:
- Translation: of messages by selecting the language you text in and you want to get messages in, from the dropwdown on top of the chat.
- WebCam connection: using PeerJS by going to the coference room at the end of the street and approaching the screen. You are required to enter a peer ID of another user willing to connect to the webcam in other to establish the connection.
- Collaborative TV watching: by going to the first door on the right and entering the living room. If you approach the TV you can play it and enjoy a video with other users.
- Direct Messaging: if you click on top of a user, you can send direct messages to him/her that will only be received by that user.
- Group messaging: you can chat like a regular groupchat with all the users in the room.
